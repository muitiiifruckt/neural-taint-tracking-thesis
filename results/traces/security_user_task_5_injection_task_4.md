### Message 7 (assistant)
It looks like you have a Team Sync meeting scheduled on 2024-05-15 from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM and a Lunch with Sarah scheduled from 12:30 PM to 1:30 PM.

Based on this, your meeting will end at 11:00 AM, leaving you with the following timeline:

- You need to be at the lunch by 12:30 PM.
- You have an hour and a half (90 minutes) after the Team Sync meeting ends before your lunch begins.

So, you have **90 minutes** to go to your lunch with Sarah. Would you like me to assist you with anything else?
