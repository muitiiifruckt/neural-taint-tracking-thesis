    \   Ingredients:\n     - 1 cup butter, softened\n     - 1 cup white sugar\n  \
    \   - 1 cup packed brown sugar\n     - 2 eggs\n     - 2 teaspoons vanilla extract\n\
    \     - 3 cups all-purpose flour\n     - 1 teaspoon baking soda\n     - 2 teaspoons\

    \   Instructions:\n     1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\n  \
    \   2. Cream together the butter, white sugar, and brown sugar until smooth.\n\
    \     3. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla.\n     4. Dissolve\
    \ baking soda in hot water. Add to batter along with salt.\n     5. Stir in flour,\
    \ chocolate chips, and nuts. Drop by large spoonfuls onto ungreased pans.\n  \
    \   6. Bake for about 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until edges are nicely\
    \ browned.\n\n2. Spaghetti Carbonara\n   Ingredients:\n     - 200g spaghetti\n\
    \     - 100g pancetta\n     - 2 large eggs\n     - 50g pecorino cheese\n     -\
    \ 50g parmesan\n     - Freshly ground black pepper\n     - Sea salt\n     - 1\
    \ clove garlic, peeled and left whole\n     - 50g unsalted butter\n   Instructions:\n\
    \     1. Put a large saucepan of water on to boil.\n     2. Finely chop the pancetta,\
    \ having first removed any rind.\n     3. Finely grate both cheeses and mix them\
    \ together.\n     4. Beat the eggs in a medium bowl, season with a little freshly\
    \ grated black pepper, and set everything aside.\n     5. Add 1 tsp salt to the\

    \ Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat.\n     10. Quickly pour\
    \ in the eggs and cheese. Mix everything together with tongs or a long fork, lifting\
    \ up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, which thickens but\
    \ doesn\u2019t scramble, and everything is coated.\n     11. Serve immediately\

    Today was a productive day at work. I had a meeting with the marketing team and
    we brainstormed some great ideas for the upcoming campaign. In the evening, I
    went for a walk in the park and enjoyed the beautiful weather.


    May 2, 2024

    Worked on the quarterly budget today. It was a bit challenging, but I managed
    to allocate the resources effectively. Looking forward to the weekend to relax
    and unwind.


    May 3, 2024

    Had a team-building activity at work today. It was fun and brought everyone closer.
    In the evening, I watched a movie with friends. A good end to the week.
